   <!-- PARAGRAPH AND BULLET POINTS--> 
    <p> I have been natural for 10 years now and like many, I have gone through bottles of different products. At the beginning of my journey, I must  admit that I was a product junkie. Soon I realized that:</p>

    <ul class="hairnav">
      <li> This cost too much money.</li>
      <li> The products and oils I used as a young girl still worked on my hair.</li>

    </ul>
    
  
    <p> I stumbled across Bella Curls at my local Family Dollar store while looking for a leave in moisturizer. I had never heard of these products but the prices were great. I decided to buy the Leave in Conditioner and Curls Defnining Creme. Both of these products leave my hair super soft and shiny. My hair is a bit on the dry side, so I am always looking for products that deliver in the moisture department and these products do not disappoint.  The moisture it provides is AMAZING! It does not leave my hair feeling heavy like some products and my twist outs are more defined. The products smell great as well. I highly recommend this line to any one looking for an affordable natural hair care line..</p>
